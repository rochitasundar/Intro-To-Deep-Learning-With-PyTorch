### DeepLearning-With-PyTorch

This repository contains my code solutions to Udacity's coursework ['Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch'](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) (-- in progress).

**Course 1: Introduction to Neural Networks**

  - Implementing a 1 layer neural network, training using gradient descent to predict student admissions at UCLA. 
  
**Course 2: Introduction to PyTorch** 

  - Implementing a multi layer neural network architecture using PyTorch for Fashion-MNIST dataset, using regularization to generalize performance on training and validation sets. 
  
**Course 3: Convolutional Neural Networks**

- Implementing a multi layer convolutional neural network architecture with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers for CIFAR-10 dataset, using data augmentation and early stopping to improve performance. 
- Leveraging a pre-trained network: DenseNet, previously trained on ImageNet dataset and implementing transfer learning to classify pictures of cats and dogs.

**Course 4: Style Transfer**

- Leveraging a pre-trained network: VGG as a fixed feature extractor to create new images by merging the content of one image with the style of another image. The feature layers of a target image are compared with the original content and style image layers to calculate content loss and style loss (via., gram matrix calculations of convolutional layers) and thereby used to iteratively update the target image via back propagartion.
