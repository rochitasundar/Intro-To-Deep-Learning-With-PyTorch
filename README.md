### DeepLearning-With-PyTorch

This repository contains my code solutions to Udacity's coursework ['Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch'](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) (-- in progress).

**Course 1: Introduction to Neural Networks**

  - Implementing a 1 layer neural network, training using gradient descent to predict student admissions at UCLA. 
  
**Course 2: Introduction to PyTorch** 

  - Implementing a multi layer neural network architecture using PyTorch for Fashion-MNIST dataset, using regularization to generalize performance on training and validation sets.
